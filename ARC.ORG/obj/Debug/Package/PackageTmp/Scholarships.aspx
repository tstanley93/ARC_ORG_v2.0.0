<h2>Scholarship Guidelines</h2>
<br />
<h3>The Arcin’ Round the Community scholarship is for any individual with a developmental disability that is interested in becoming involved with a Grays Harbor event or program.  Our main goal is to provide monetary support for individuals to become involved with inclusive programs that they were otherwise unable to afford.  </h3>
<br />
<h3>An example of scholarship requests could be:  Arcin’ Round monthly events, swim lessons at the YMCA, baseball camp, cheer camp, summer camps, etc.  As long as you are getting out there in an inclusive setting in Grays Harbor we would like to help!  Whether it’s a partial or full payment to the event you apply for, we will most certainly do what we can!</h3>
<br />
<h3>For a person to apply they must have at least one of these:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><h3>A medical diagnosis of a developmental disability.</h3></li>
    <li><h3>I.E.P.</h3> </li>
    <li><h3>Social Security benefits</h3></li>
</ol>

<h3>At this time there is no limit to the number of times a person may apply for a scholarship throughout the year.  First time applicants do take first priority though. </h3>
<br />
<h3> All that is required to apply is to:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><h3>Fill out a scholarship application in advance to the event or program.</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Participate throughout the duration of the event.</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Short report on the event.</h3></li>
</ol>

<h3>You will be notified with an answer, by mail or phone, within two weeks after the scholarship request is received.  If the scholarship request is granted a check will be made payable to the program or group that is sponsoring the event.  </h3>
