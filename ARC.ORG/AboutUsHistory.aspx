        <h3>In 1936, a group of 
            parents who’s children where in the institutions formed The Children’s 
            Benevolent League of Washington (CBL). In 1960’s CBL changed its name to Washington Association for Retarded 
            Children (WARC), later becoming the Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC).Back in the day (which is, 
            unfortunately, not so long ago) the word retarded was commonly used when 
            referring to people with developmental disabilities, just as African and Native 
            Americans where referred to as Indians, negro’s, and blacks. As the years 
            passed, many professionals working in the field of Mental Retardation started to 
            perceive the term “retarded” as degrading and started pushing those labeled as 
            such to seek another change in the name of the organization.
             Thus, the current name for The Arc of 
            Washington State evolved (Advocates for the Rights of Citizens with 
            developmental disabilities).  Today 
            The Arc of Grays Harbor acronym stands for Advocacy, respect, community for ALL 
            people with developmental disabilities.</h3><br />
        <h3>Back at the beginning 
            families had nothing, no mandated laws, schooling, or an employment protection.It was up to them to assist their 
            love ones in belonging and having the right to a better life. The seed was planted for The Arc movement in church basements 
            as parents, professionals and other caring community members came together and 
            began educating their communities, their schools, their state legislatures and 
            the U.S. Congress about people with developmental disabilities.</h3><br />
            
<h3>In the early fifties, a shift in attitudes – away from 
            institutional care – began to emerge.During this time, Washington
            experienced a growth in the number of parents who started looking at educating 
            and raising their children in their homes and communities.As a result,
 Washington was a pacesetter in providing expanded local educational opportunities 
            for children with disabilities.</h3><br />
     <h3>In 1969, the organization recommended that The Arc support 
            mandatory public schooling for all children. Support was tremendous, and the final passage of the bill in 1973 made it 
            law. Attention was focused on the 
            federal level by passing the Education for all handicapped children act of 
            1975--Public Law 94-142.</h3><br />
       <h3>Meanwhile for the residents of Grays Harbor and Pacific County 
            The Arc (formally know The Arc of Twin Harbors) was very active. Members/partners were determined to 
            see positive changes in our area:</h3><br />

            their children with special needs for public education.
              The beginning of what many of us are 
            receiving today without a second thought.</h3>

                        Adults 
            with developmental disabilities had the opportunity to continue to develop 
            skills and socializing outside of their family home at what is known today as 
            Timberland Opportunity. The birth of 
            community training and employment. Look where it has grown today, people with disabilities working in our 
            grocery stores, state offices, corporations, etc.

            Harbor Alternate Living Association (HALA) in 1980. This program supports individuals 
            with developmental disabilities (including those with significant needs of 24 
            hour support) who want to rent their own apartment, house, and live independent 
            from their families.
            Individuals live by themselves or with one to three other people.</h3>

        <br />
        <h3>In the mid 80’s and 90’s chapters began having difficulties.The next generation of families 
            with children with special needs where not aware that public education, services 
            and programs for their children came about only because of the relentless 
            efforts of the pioneering parents, professionals and caring citizens and not 
            because the State of Washington simply saw their child and families need and 
            wanted to fill it. As more children 
            were being diagnosed and put in the Developmental Disability system there was 
            less people advocating for increased funding to cover services which lead to the 
            waiting list and the inadequate funding for services we are experiencing today.</h3><br />
            <h3>In September of 1999 Grays Harbor County sponsored an “All in 
            the Family” Conference, through that conference The Arc of Grays Harbor was 
            revitalized obtaining Articles of Incorporation status in December 1999 and 
            operating under The Arc of Washington State until July 1<sup>st</sup>, 2004 when 
            it became its own chapter. </h3><br />
        <h3>Today, The Arc of Grays Harbor, Washington State and U.S. 
            continue to embody the passionate advocacy of its rich history as it strives to 
            promote inclusion in all aspects of life for people with developmental 
            disabilities. </h3><br/>
